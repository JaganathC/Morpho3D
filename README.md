✨ **How It Works**


Start by sketching freely on the 2D canvas ✏️, letting your creativity flow without limits. Once your sketch is ready, tap the "Improve Drawing" button 🎨 to refine it into a more detailed and polished piece of art. When you're satisfied, hit "Make 3D" 🧱 to seamlessly convert your 2D drawing into a lifelike 3D model. Next, switch to the 3D World tab 🌍 to place your models into an interactive environment, bringing your creations to life. Continue to iterate and enhance 🔁 your models by redrawing or using text prompts ✏️🗣️ for more precise adjustments. Finally, with just one click, export your 3D world 📤📁 in the standard .glTF format, making it easy to integrate with your existing tools 🚀.
